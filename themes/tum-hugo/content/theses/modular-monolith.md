In the rapidly evolving landscape of educational technology, scalable and maintainable software architectures are crucial for the success of learning management systems (LMS). This thesis explores the transformation of Artemis, an open-source LMS, from a monolithic architecture into a modular system using Java Modules. By modularizing Artemis, we aim to enhance the systemâ€™s scalability, maintainability, and development efficiency. The thesis delves into the challenges of decomposing a large monolithic codebase, the strategies employed for effective module separation, and the benefits realized post-modularization. This research provides a comprehensive guide for developers and engineers aiming to modernize legacy monolithic applications in the educational technology domain.
