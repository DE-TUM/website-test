Artemis is an interactive learning platform that is evolving towards a powerful university course management system.
Currently, Artemis only supports basic communication features enabling users to ask questions on specific exercises and
lectures, which can be up- and down-voted. Instructors therefore complement Artemis with external communication
platforms such as Slack, Zulip, and Rocket.Chat which allow more elaborate course discussions and information sharing.
This causes redundancy and scattered information, which bears the risk of worse learning experience, increased
moderation efforts, and decreased user engagement. In this thesis, we address these problems by analyzing complementing
communication platforms, other course management systems, and popular online class platforms. Based on the gained
insights, we enhance Artemis’ current discussion capabilities. We add features for course-wide announcements and
duplication checks, as well as for pinning, archiving, moving, resolving, searching, filtering, tagging, and
referencing posts. Moreover, by integrating emojis, we provide users with the ability to express reactions and engage
with their peers. The new capabilities allow for fast and intuitive information retrieval, e↵ective and ecient
discussion moderation, and interactive conversations. They enhance Artemis’ capabilities with regard to social
interactions and information sharing to multiply the user engagement. Our new communication features are currently
actively used by 1,700 students in 9 university courses conducted with Artemis.
