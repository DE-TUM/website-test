Research suggests that learning paths might positively impact students' academic success. Artemis also recently introduced learning paths, however, they are rarely used due to the creation process being time-consuming and having poor usability. In this thesis, we will add improvements to the creation and import processes of competencies, which are the basis for learning paths. To achieve this, we will conduct user interviews with instructors, identifying the changes providing the largest benefit and implementing those. Additionally, we will explore the possibility to automatically generate competencies leveraging the power of large language models.
