In this thesis, the goal is to enhance the contextual awareness of a GPT-based educational chatbot, named IRIS, on the Artemis Learning Platform by incorporating lecture content. To do this, the lecture slides should be embedded into a vector database, and the chatbot should be able to retrieve the most relevant slides based on the user's query in order to provide the most relevant answer.

Artemis is open source and available on https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis
