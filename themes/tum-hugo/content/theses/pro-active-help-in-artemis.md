The challenges encountered by students during the completion of exercises necessitate the implementation of a proactive assistance mechanism within Artemis. This could potentially be achieved through the integration of generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT. The objective of this thesis is to augment Artemis with the capability to provide automatic and proactive assistance to students when they encounter difficulties. The effectiveness and impact of this approach on the learning experience will be evaluated through a comprehensive assessment.
