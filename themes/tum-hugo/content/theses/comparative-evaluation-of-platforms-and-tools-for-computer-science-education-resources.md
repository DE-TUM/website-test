The need for effective digital platforms that support pupils and educators in computer science education is rising. This thesis seeks to evaluate existing platforms, such as Code.org, CS Unplugged, and ScratchEd, based on criteria including accessibility, usability, and adaptability. It will also examine whether these platforms incorporate configurators that allow teachers to input parameters such as pupil age, class size, and lesson duration. Based on this analysis, the thesis will propose recommendations and develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a configurator tool. The tool will be tested and refined in collaboration with educators to support the creation of tailored lesson plans and improve engagement in diverse classroom settings.
