TUM lacks a unified, user-friendly platform for managing doctoral applications. Fragmented systems lead to inconsistent information, limited transparency, and accessibility barriers. Unclear navigation and outdated interfaces hinder applicants, while manual tasks burden faculty and staff. A centralized, inclusive solution is needed.

This thesis designs and implements the user interface and interaction architecture of [TUMApply](https://tumapply.aet.cit.tum.de/), a platform developed to address these challenges. It applies inclusive UX patterns, role-based workflows, and integrated user management, including authentication and research group support. Adhering to WCAG 2.1ยน, the project strengthens recruitment through better usability and inclusivity.
