Computer science education in schools often fails to engage school students with diverse prior knowledge. Many existing educational tools also lack gender-sensitive design, particularly at the foundational level when girls are making critical future career decisions. This thesis will evaluate digital and unplugged games in computer science education to enhance computational thinking and address adaptive learning needs. The study will identify the strengths and limitations of these tools, focusing on their adaptability and ability to engage young girls. 
Based on these findings, the research will provide evidence-based recommendations and best practices for integrating gender-sensitive and adaptive strategies into computing education. In addition, the study will include the development and testing of an interactive game with multiple levels of difficulty designed to engage all genders. The results will provide valuable insights for improving computer science education, fostering inclusive learning environments and promoting greater gender balance.
