Artemis has made significant strides in facilitating interactive learning experiences for students. However, its user experience (UX) remains in need of refinement. It exhibits minor inconsistencies, logical inaccuracies, and layout issues in several views. Since instructors have access to more extensive and complex features, these problems occur more frequently here as well. This bachelorâ€™s thesis aims to address this issue by identifying and eliminating disparities and implementing key UX improvements, ultimately leading to a more effective and enjoyable educational environment. Furthermore, the current feature design process and design guidelines will be reviewed to prevent the recurrent reintroduction of inconsistencies and unfavorable UX.
