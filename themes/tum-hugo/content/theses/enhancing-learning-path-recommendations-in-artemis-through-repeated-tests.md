Artemis is a learning management platform that offers students different exercise types as well as lecture materials. To help students navigate the exercises and lectures Artemis offers learning paths and makes suggestions about the order of the resources. This thesis aims to optimize the learning path recommendations within Artemis by integrating repeated testing and improving the accuracy and transparency of progress metrics. The expected outcome is a more efficient and engaging learning experience for students, with personalized suggestions that adapt to their learning pace and needs.
