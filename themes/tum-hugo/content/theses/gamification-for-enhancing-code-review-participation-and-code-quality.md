In this thesis, we develop a gamification-based system to enhance the code review process by increasing participation and improving code quality. By integrating gamification elements such as points, levels, badges, and leaderboards into existing code review platforms, we aim to create a more engaging and motivating environment for developers. Our system provides real-time feedback through a user-friendly web interface, and seamlessly integrates with popular development tools to support continuous workflows.
The primary contribution is a versatile framework adaptable to various code review systems, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration among developers. To evaluate the systemâ€™s effectiveness, we will conduct a comprehensive user study involving multiple development teams. This study will use both quantitative metrics, such as participation rates and review quality scores, as well as qualitative feedback from user surveys and interviews. The results will provide detailed insights into the impact of gamification on code review practices, demonstrating its potential to enhance software development processes and other collaborative environments.
