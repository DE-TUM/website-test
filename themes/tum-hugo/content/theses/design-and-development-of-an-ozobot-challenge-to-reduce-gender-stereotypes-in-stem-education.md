This thesis designs, implements and evaluates a board game using Ozobots to address gender stereotypes in STEM education among elementary students. It reviews gender-sensitive strategies, assesses robotics tools for inclusivity, and develops an engaging board game to promote equal participation and interest in STEM fields for both boys and girls.

Pupils playtest two board games that are identical in structure but differ in theme. Each version addresses a distinct gender stereotype. The process records engagement, collaboration, and individual perceptions through structured surveys and classroom observations. The collected data will provide insights into pupilsâ€™ confidence and participation levels, guiding refinements to enhance inclusivity.
