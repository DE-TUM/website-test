This thesis proposal addresses communication challenges in Artemis. The
aim is to enhance Artemis by introducing a refined communication module.
The identified problems include duplication in communication sections, ab-
sence of document-sharing, and limitations in threaded conversations. Moti-
vated by the need for a robust communication platform, this thesis proposal
suggests improvements guided by Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics. Key objectives involve
a unified messaging system, enhanced message thread functionality, collabo-
rative document sharing, and improved UI design.
