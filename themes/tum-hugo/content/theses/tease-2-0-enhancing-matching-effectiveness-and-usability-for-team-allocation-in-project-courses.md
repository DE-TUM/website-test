This thesis contributes to the enhancement of the Team Allocator for Software Engineering courses, an open-source tool for forming student teams. The focus is on optimizing data import and export functionalities, refining the matching algorithm, improving the user interface and experience, and implementing a serverside component to enable synchronous multi-user collaboration. The methodology employed is agile development with 2-3 week product increments, allowing for regular testing and release cycles. The main contribution of this work lies in providing significant upgrades to the TEASE project, enhancing its usability and efficiency in project-based educational settings. Through these improvements, the thesis aims to extend the toolâ€™s applicability and effectiveness, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for the project management.
