To enhance Artemis as a more dynamic and approachable platform for TUM students and external users, itâ€™s important to ensure compatibility with and integration into other learning platforms. One way to accomplish this is by using the Learning Tool Interoperability standard, which allows for the seamless integration of different Artemis features into platforms like Moodle or edX.
The primary objective of this thesis is to further improve the functionality and scope of the Learning Tool Interoperability integration. A major focus is to ensure that all Artemis features are easily accessible from Moodle, facilitating a smoother and more integrated experience for users unfamiliar with Artemis. These features encompass various aspects of the Artemis platform including competencies, lecture and exercise selection, learning paths, and the Iris dashboard.
