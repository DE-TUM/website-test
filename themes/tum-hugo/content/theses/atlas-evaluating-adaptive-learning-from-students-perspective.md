Competency-based education gives students transparency and flexibility in their learning process. The usage can enhance motivation, especially in university settings where instructors address students with diverse backgrounds and prior knowledge together. Therefore, Artemis contains the adaptive learning system Atlas to support university teaching. To provide the best experience possible to students, it is essential to understand how students currently interact with the system integrated into Artemis and its impacts on their learning process.

This thesis aims to analyze and evaluate the current system from the studentâ€™s perspective by monitoring usage and performance indicators within the system and a survey questioning students about their perception of the system. These insights can reveal future potential for improvements of Atlas.
