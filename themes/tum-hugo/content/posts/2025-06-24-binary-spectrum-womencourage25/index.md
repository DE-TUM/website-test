We are happy to share that a poster about our Binary Spectrum app, a gender-inclusive learning app for middle school computer science education, has been accepted at ACM womENcourage 2025 in Brașov 🇷🇴.


📱 Binary Spectrum is an educational iPad app developed to teach foundational CS concepts through interactive mini-games. It fosters an inclusive learning environment that supports different skill levels and actively counters gender disparities — a challenge still very present in today's computing classrooms.


✨ The project emerged from the master's thesis of Lorena K. Vitale, whose work is driven by a strong commitment to educational equity. With Binary Spectrum, she tackles structural imbalances in computer science by making the subject approachable, fun, and empowering, ensuring that all learners feel invited in.


👩‍🎓 Diversity and inclusion aren’t side topics, they are central to creating meaningful, lasting change in tech education. This project shows how thoughtful design can make CS more accessible to everyone, regardless of background or identity.
