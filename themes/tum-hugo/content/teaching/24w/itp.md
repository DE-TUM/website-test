### Learning Objectives

Students understand the essential concepts of computer science on a basic,
practical, but scientific level. They can solve manageable algorithmic problems and implement basic applications
in Java or a similar object-oriented language on their own. They understand the underlying concepts and models and are 
able to acquire skills in other object-oriented programming languages on their own.

### Grading

The following activities determine the final grade for this course:

| Activity                                                         | Weight   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Supervised Exercise 1 (Tuesday, 03.12.2024, 19:00 - 20:40)       | 30%      |
| Supervised Exercise 2 (Monday, 10.02.2025, 19:00 - 20:40)        | 30%      |
| Team project (incl. presentation early February in tutor groups) | 30%      | 
| Presentations (homework + tutor exercise)                        | 10%      |
| **Total**                                                        | **100%** |
| Bonus for selected exercises                                     | up to 5% |
| Bonus for extra team project features                            | up to 5% |


**Important:** 
- Supervised exercises are computer-based and take place onsite in a lecture hall in Garching. Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, work in a computer lab. It is not possible to participate remotely. The presentations will take place in the tutorial groups onsite.
- For the team project, it is mandatory to attend the tutor groups in January.

#### Retake

For students who do not pass the course, a retake opportunity will be offered. The retake is completely independent of the above course activities, i.e. no grades or bonuses can be transferred.

The retake will consist of **two** exams, each with a duration of 90 minutes plus 10 minutes for technical problems.
Both exams will contribute 50% to the final grade. You have to participate in both exams to be able to pass the retake.

The dates of the retake exams are:
- **Retake exam 1:** Monday, 31.03.2025, 19:00 - 20:40
- **Retake exam 2:** Wednesday, 02.04.2025, 19:00 - 20:40

Both retake exams are computer-based and take place onsite (i.e. under supervision) in a lecture hall in Garching. Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, take the exam in a computer lab. It is **not** possible to participate remotely.
In TUMOnline, both retake exams appear as a *single exam* you have to register for. It will only show the date of the first retake exam, but you have to attend both exams to be graded.
