### Course Description

In this seminar, you will research and develop exercises and concepts for interactive learning courses.
You will create and implement exercises for the Artemis platform, widely used in various courses at TUM.
Working in small teams, you will collaborate with course lecturers to develop exercises and learning concepts that enhance students' software engineering skills.

Additionally, you will be involved in the development of learning tools like Artemis.
Your tasks will include proposing requirements to support new teaching concepts and conducting user tests to ensure these requirements are met.

By the end of the semester, you will write a seminar paper, conduct a peer review, and present your findings.
