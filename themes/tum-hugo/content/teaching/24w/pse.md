### Learning Objectives

Students learn the principles of patterns in software development and the structure of pattern-based software systems. They become familiar with the application of patterns in a variety of situations and apply the pattern in concrete applications. They practice the application of the patterns in exercises during interactive workshops.

Note the special course format: Interactive workshops combine theory and practice following the interactive learning philosophy: you practice a pattern right after it was introduced.
