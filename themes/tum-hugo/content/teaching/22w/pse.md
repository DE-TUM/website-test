### Intended Learning Outcomes
You will learn the principles of patterns in software development and the structure of pattern-based software systems. You will also become familiar how to apply patterns in a variety of problem situations and how handle the patterns in concrete applications. You will practice application of the patterns in exercises during the lecture.

Note the special course format: Lectures and exercises are not separated, they are **heavily intertwined**. The course _blends exercises with the lecture_: you practice a pattern right after it was introduced in the lecture.

### Announcements

#### 17.10.2022: Important Information
We will teach the course **Patterns in Software Engineering (PSE)** as an on-site course in Garching at **MI HS 1**.
We highly encourage you to attend the lecture in person in HS1. There will be a live stream of the lectures on [live.rbg.tum.de](https://live.rbg.tum.de/course/2022/W/pse) for the rare events when you cannot be present, and recordings available afterward. We recommend to actively participate in the exercises during the lecture. The tutors will be present during the lecture in person and help you in case of problems.

We will provide more information on the course format in the first lecture on Monday, October 24th, from 10:00 to 14:00. **Please make sure to attend this lecture!**

Our tutors are available in our Slack Workspace to support you. Please sign up at [patterns22.slack.com](https://patterns22.slack.com/signup) with your **@tum.de** email address. You can find materials and exercises in the course "Patterns in Software Engineering (WS 22/23)" on [Artemis](https://artemis.tum.de/).

Before the first lecture starts, we would like you to use the free time to repeat 5 patterns that we have already covered in "Introduction to Software Engineering" (EIST). We uploaded the lecture slides, recordings, and exercises to Artemis, they will be available starting on Monday, October 17th. Please review the slides, watch the videos, and complete the exercises before the first lecture on October 24th. This content is also relevant for the examination and **the exercise counts towards a grade bonus** (we will tell you more about the bonus in the first actual lecture).

If you have not used Artemis before, please log in to https://artemis.tum.de with your TUM account and follow the guided tutorials. In case you have questions, please post them on Slack in [#tools](https://patterns22.slack.com/archives/C0473FX6HEV).
