### Intended Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the module, participants understand the essential concepts of computer science on a basic,
practical, but scientific level. Participants can solve manageable algorithmic problems and implement basic applications
in Java or a similar object-oriented language on their own. They understand the underlying concepts and models and are
therefore able to acquire skills in other object-oriented programming languages on their own.
