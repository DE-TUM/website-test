This September, we're heading back to the mountains â€“ and into the future of higher education. â›° ðŸš€ 

Join us for a remarkable two-week academic adventure in the breathtaking Sarntal valley (South Tyrol)! The Ferienakademie, jointly organized by TUM, Erlangen, and Stuttgart universities, blends intensive learning with inspiring outdoor experiences, lively discussions, and meaningful connections. It's your chance to collaborate closely with peers and professors in a relaxed yet intellectually stimulating mountain environmentâ€”truly academia at its best.

We are excited to present the course **"Innovative Learning with Generative AI: Developing Intelligent Educational Applications"**. This course is part of the Ferienakademie 2025 and will take place from **September 21 to October 3, 2025**.

### Course Description
In this innovative course, students will design and build a virtual teaching avatar powered by GenAI â€“ capable of delivering lectures that adapt to learners' prior knowledge, experiences, and the level of detail needed to understand new concepts. Rather than simply automating content delivery, we'll rethink the professor's role as a content curator. 

We'll explore fundamental questions about the future of education:
- How can we tailor education to individuals at scale?
- What does responsible AI integration in the classroom look like?
- How can user-centered design principles shape the future of digital learning?

With guidance from Prof. Stephan Krusche (TUM) and Prof. Steffen Becker (University of Stuttgart), as well as support from Patrick Bassner and Niklas MeiÃŸner, you'll prototype solutions, challenge assumptions, and explore how GenAI can truly empower students and educators alike.

**Target audience:** Informatics, Information Systems, Games Engineering (Bachelor students from 4th semester onwards and Master students)  
**Language:** English

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming experience
- Curiosity about AI, large language models, and prompt engineering
- Previous exposure to AI concepts is beneficial but not essential

### Learning Objectives
- Grasp the fundamentals of generative AI  
- Develop practical AI-based educational tools  
- Tackle authentic educational problems with innovative solutions  
- Understand ethical implications of AI in education
