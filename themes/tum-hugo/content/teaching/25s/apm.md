### Course Description

In this **onsite** course, you gain in-depth, hands-on experience in managing agile projects. As a coach, you oversee real software development teams — often international and cross-functional — who are simultaneously working on an industry-backed projects. You guide your teams through every phase of agile development, from sprint planning to delivery, while ensuring effective collaboration, quality control, and continuous improvement.

You practice key project management activities, including release planning, backlog refinement, modeling system architecture, and ensuring code quality. Regular coaching meetings with fellow coaches and course instructors provide a platform to discuss progress, address challenges, and plan upcoming work. This immersive environment helps you develop the essential leadership and communication skills needed to navigate real-world project complexities.

### Prerequisites

You have previously participated in a project at the chair of Prof. Krusche or Prof. Bruegge (e.g., iPraktikum) or have equivalent practical exposure to agile methods like Scrum.
You possess several years of experience in at least one object-oriented programming language (e.g., Swift, Java, Objective-C, Python, C++, C#) and have implemented iOS apps or similar software projects before.

Experience in mobile application development, usability engineering, or prior project management roles is beneficial. Strong English communication skills are required for effective coaching and client interaction.

### Learning Objectives

You refine your ability to coach and motivate a team in an agile environment. By facilitating sprint ceremonies—like stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint reviews—you ensure the team remains focused, collaborative, and goal-oriented.
You learn to plan and execute releases effectively, manage changing requirements, mitigate risks, and balance technical debt with feature development. Through continuous observation and feedback loops, you gain practical insight into prioritization, resource allocation, and stakeholder communication.
You regularly coordinate with team members, industry clients, and instructors, honing your communication and conflict-resolution skills. By promoting transparency and trust, you foster an environment where problems are surfaced and addressed early.
You apply Scrum and related agile practices (e.g., Kanban boards, user story mapping) in a real setting with demanding deadlines and deliverables. This exposure emphasizes adaptability, quick iteration, and responding effectively to change.

You guide teams in maintaining high-quality code, performing efficient code reviews, and adhering to continuous integration and delivery pipelines. By overseeing technical modeling and system architecture discussions, you ensure the project remains scalable and maintainable.
You gain experience in recognizing and addressing issues such as scope creep, team conflicts, and evolving customer requirements. By leveraging coaching techniques and agile principles, you learn to resolve impediments that threaten team morale or project success.
You strengthen your leadership style by taking responsibility for project outcomes. Through reflection and feedback, you improve not only your project management capabilities but also your interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and professional confidence.
