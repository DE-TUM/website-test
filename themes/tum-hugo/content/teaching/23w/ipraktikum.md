### Course Description

In this __onsite__ course, you develop mobile applications in the context of a larger system architecture. Depending on the project, you work with application servers, machine learning algorithms, smart sensors, intelligent clothing, wearables like the Apple Watch or micro-controllers.

You get to know workflows, activities and tools of state-of-the-art agile software engineering, in particular agile hardware/software co-development, from requirements engineering to system delivery. You learn Appleâ€™s programming language Swift, UI frameworks such as SwiftUI, and modern paradigms for asynchronous programming. You gain hands-on knowledge in the fields of system modeling, usability engineering and continuous integration and delivery.

Industry partners provide real problem statements. You get real team and project experience while working tightly together with a real client towards a real deadline.
