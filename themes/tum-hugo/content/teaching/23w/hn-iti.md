### Intended Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the module, participants understand the essential concepts of computer science on a basic,
practical, but scientific level. Participants can solve manageable algorithmic problems and implement basic applications
in Java or a similar object-oriented language on their own. They understand the underlying concepts and models and are
therefore able to acquire skills in other object-oriented programming languages on their own.

### Grading

The final grade for this course is determined according to the following grading scheme:

| Course activities                               | Grade Percentage |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Final exam (Tuesday, 20.02.2024, 15:30 - 17:10) | 100%             |
| **Total**                                       | **100%**         |
| Bonus for selected lecture exercises            | up to 10%        |

**Important:** The exam is computer-based and takes place onsite (i.e. under supervision) in a lecture hall in Heilbronn.  Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, take the exam in the computer lab. It is **not** possible to participate remotely.

#### Retake

A retake opportunity will be offered for students who do not pass the course. The retake is entirely independent of the above course activities, i.e., no grades or bonuses can be transferred.

The retake will consist of one exam, 90 minutes plus 10 minutes for technical problems.

The date of the retake exam is:
- **INHN0001 Retake exam:** Tuesday, 09.04.2024, 14:00 - 15:40

The retake exam is computer-based and will be on site (i.e., under supervision) in a lecture hall on Heilbronnâ€™s campus. Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, take the exam in the computer lab. It is **not** possible to participate remotely.
In TUMOnline, the retake exam appears as a *single exam* you have to register for.
