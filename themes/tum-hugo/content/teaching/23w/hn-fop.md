### Intended Learning Outcomes
After successful completion of the module, participants are acquainted with the object-oriented programming language Java and
master programming in the small. They are able to realize programs on their own and to apply the fundamental concepts of
Informatics as taught in module INHN0001, on a basic practical but scientific level. Accompanying the module INHN0001,
assignments may exercise and apply for problem solving concepts, such as basic data structures, recursion, objects, classes
and methods, lists, queues, and trees, advanced concepts of object-oriented programming, and concurrency.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Intermediate exam 1 (supervised homework, Monday, 20.11.2023, 19:00 - 20:40)     | 20%              |
| Intermediate exam 2 (supervised homework, Monday, **11.12.2023**, 19:00 - 20:40) | 30%              |
| Project work: development of a game (January)                                    | 30%              |
| Presentations (homework + tutor exercise)                                        | 20%              |
| **Total**                                                                        | **100%**         |
| Bonus for selected homework exercises                                            | up to 10%        |



**Important:** Intermediate exams (supervised homework) are computer-based and take place onsite (i.e. under supervision) in a lecture hall in Heilbronn.  Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, take the exam in the computer lab. It is **not** possible to participate remotely. The presentations will take place in the tutorial groups onsite. Further details about the project work will be announced later in December.

#### Retake

A retake opportunity will be offered for students who do not pass the course. The retake is entirely independent of the above course activities, i.e., no grades or bonuses can be transferred.

The retake will consist of one exam, 90 minutes plus 10 minutes for technical problems.

The date of the retake exam is:
- **INHN0002 Retake exam:** Thursday, 11.04.2024, 16:30 - 18:10

The retake exam is computer-based and will be on site (i.e., under supervision) in a lecture hall on Heilbronnâ€™s campus. Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, take the exam in the computer lab. It is **not** possible to participate remotely.
In TUMOnline, the retake exam appears as a *single exam* you have to register for.
