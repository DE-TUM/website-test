### Intended Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the module, participants understand the essential concepts of computer science on a basic,
practical, but scientific level. Participants can solve manageable algorithmic problems and implement basic applications
in Java or a similar object-oriented language on their own. They understand the underlying concepts and models and are
therefore able to acquire skills in other object-oriented programming languages on their own.

### Grading

The final grade for this course is determined according to the following grading scheme:

| Course activities                                                            | Grade Percentage |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Intermediate exam 1 (supervised homework, Monday, 20.11.2023, 19:00 - 20:40) | 20%              |
| Intermediate exam 2 (supervised homework, Monday, 11.12.2023, 19:00 - 20:40) | 20%              |
| Project work: development of a game (January)                                | 20%              | 
| Final exam (Tuesday, 20.02.2024, 15:30 - 17:10)                              | 30%              |
| Presentations (homework + tutor exercise)                                    | 10%              |
| **Total**                                                                    | **100%**         |
| Bonus for selected lecture and homework exercises                            | up to 10%        |
| Bonus for extra project work features                                        | up to 10%        |

**Important:** Intermediate exams (supervised homework) and the final exam are computer-based and take place onsite (i.e. under supervision) in a lecture hall in Garching (or Munich). Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, take the exam in the computer lab. It is **not** possible to participate remotely. The presentations will take place in the tutorial groups onsite.

#### Retake

For students who do not pass the course, a retake opportunity will be offered. The retake is completely independent of the above course activities, i.e. no grades or bonuses can be transferred.

The retake will consist of **two** exams, each with a duration of 90 minutes plus 10 minutes for technical problems.
Both exams will contribute 50% to the final grade. You have to participate in both exams to be able to pass the retake.

The dates of the retake exams are:
- **Retake exam 1:** Tuesday, 09.04.2024, 14:00 - 15:40
- **Retake exam 2:** Thursday, 11.04.2024, 16:30 - 18:10

Both retake exams are computer-based and will take place onsite (i.e. under supervision) in a lecture hall in Garching. Students bring their own notebook or, if that is not an option, take the exam in the computer lab. It is **not** possible to participate remotely.
In TUMOnline, both retake exams appear as a *single exam* you have to register for. It will only show the date of the first retake exam, but you have to attend both exams to be graded.
