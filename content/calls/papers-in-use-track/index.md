title: "Call for Papers: In-Use Track"

---
The In-Use track of ESWC 2024 is looking for contributions that apply state-of-the-art semantic technologies or resources in real-world settings. Submissions to the In-Use track should primarily be focused on an application domain, and are expected to either:

- discuss the merits and challenges of using semantic technologies or resources to address the problems of that application domain, or
- detail the technical adaptations and/or improvements necessary to apply the semantic technologies or resources in that domain.

Submissions must demonstrate the fitness for purpose of the proposed approach, either through use by a user community or through a principled evaluation.

### Types of encouraged submissions

We welcome, but are not limited to, the following:

- Applications of semantic technologies or resources (e.g., knowledge graphs, linked data, ontologies, neuro-symbolic techniques, knowledge graph embeddings) to implement a solution for a particular problem
- Adaptations or enhancements of semantic technologies for ease of deployment, or interoperability with other technologies (e.g., NLP) or enterprise systems (e.g., relational databases)
- Experiences integrating semantic resources such as large public knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia) into deployed applications
- Descriptions and analyses of a concrete application problem and user requirements for applying semantic technology (including scalability analysis)
- Analyses and evaluations of usability and uptake of semantic technologies in specific domains
- Cost-benefit assessments of implementing, deploying, and managing particular semantic technologies
- Analyses of risks and opportunities of using semantic technologies in organisational contexts

### Delineation from other tracks

Please check other ESWC tracks to ensure optimal placement of your submission:

- **Research Track**: For novel theoretical, analytical, or empirical insights into semantic technologies and knowledge graphs
- **Industry Track**: For presenting interesting industrial applications without submitting a full paper
- **Resource Track**: For papers describing concrete datasets, ontologies, corpora, workflows, benchmarks, etc.

*Note: Research, In-Use, and Resource papers will be published in the same Springer LNCS proceedings.*

### Review Criteria

Submissions will be reviewed based on:

- Novelty and significance of the application
- Relevance and impact
- Soundness and methodological rigor
- Fitness for purpose
- Demonstrated benefits and adoption of semantic technologies
- Real-world applicability and usage
- Clarity and quality of writing
