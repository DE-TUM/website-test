## Policy on Use of Generative AI Tools

For ESWC 2026, we follow the ACM Policy on Authorship regarding the use of Generative AI:

> "Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) may not be listed as authors. Their use is allowed, but must be **disclosed** in the Acknowledgements section.  
> Example: *'ChatGPT was used to generate sections of this work, including text, tables, graphs, or code.'*
>
> Tools that perform spelling/grammar checks or basic language translation do **not** require disclosure."

If in doubt, disclose. For any questions about this policy, please contact the organizing committee.
