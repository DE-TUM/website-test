Submission guidelines

    ESWC welcomes original research and application submissions dealing with all aspects of representing and using Semantic Web technologies and Knowledge Graphs. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and applications papers. Submitted papers should describe original work, present significant results, and provide rigorous, principled, and repeatable evaluation.
    Change of authors after acceptance is not allowed. 
    We strongly encourage and appreciate links to datasets and other materials used for evaluation as well as to demos and software source code.
    ESWC will not accept work that is under review or has already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal, another conference, or another ESWC track.
    The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The preprints of the accepted papers will be available openly.
    Abstracts need to be pre-submitted followed by a timely submission of the full work.
    Papers must not exceed 15 pages (with unlimited references) and in English.
    Submissions must be either in PDF or in HTML, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). For details on the LNCS style, see Springer’s Author Instructions. For HTML submission guidance, see the HTML submission guide.
    The Research track follows a dual anonymous reviewing process. 
    The Resource and In-Use Track follow a single anonymous reviewing process.
    Authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal to the reviews to clarify questions posed by program committee members.
    At least one author per contribution must register for the conference for presentation.
    Submission is done through EasyChair. When logging in, select the appropriate track.

Use of LLM generated text

For ESWC 2026, we adhere to the principles and guidelines stated in the ACM Policy on Authorship specifically about “Criteria for Authorship” regarding the use of Generative AI technologies for authoring papers: “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work. (…) Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work. As the line between Generative AI tools and basic word processing systems like MS-Word or Grammarly becomes blurred, this Policy will be updated.”

In case of any questions regarding this policy, please contact the organizing committee.
