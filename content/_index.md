## eswc sc and swsa joint statement

_3. june 2025_

following extensive consultations, the eswc steering committee and semantic web science association (swsa) are pleased to announce that the eswc conference series will, from 2026, be overseen by swsa. this will ensure a sustainable future coordinated by peers who share our vision for data, semantics and knowledge in the age of ai.

eswc will continue as a european event with a similar format to past conferences. most importantly, the eswc culture will remain — an inclusive, open conference measuring individuals only by their research contributions, and a place where collaboration matters more than competition.

members of the existing steering committee will gradually join swsa, ensuring smooth organisation and leveraging swsa’s best practices.

> “having been involved in eswc since the very beginning, first as a participant researcher, then later as conference chair, president of sti international and chair of the steering committee, i see this move to swsa as a great step forward for the eswc community. i see us doing great things together which will be even more impactful than our previous endeavours.”  
> — john domingue, chair eswc steering committee

> “the eswc is the first academic conference i ever attended. as swsa becomes the new steward of eswc, it advances its mission towards promoting and exchanging scholarly work in semantics and related fields throughout the world. i am looking forward to working together with the eswc steering committee and the community at large to make sure the conference we all know and love remains a primary venue for publishing and presenting novel work in knowledge graphs, semantic technologies, and neurosymbolic ai.”  
> — elena simperl, swsa president
