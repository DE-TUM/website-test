<h2 id="1-honesty">1. Honesty</h2>
<p><strong>Honesty</strong> is the cornerstone of our community. We expect every member to communicate truthfully—sharing information accurately, acknowledging uncertainties, and correcting mistakes promptly. Transparent dialogue fosters mutual confidence: speak plainly about intentions, cite sources when presenting facts, and disclose any conflicts of interest. Constructive criticism should be delivered candidly yet respectfully, focusing on evidence rather than assumption. When errors occur, own them openly and outline corrective steps; this models integrity and reinforces a culture where people feel safe admitting mistakes. By embracing honesty in daily interactions—whether code reviews, meetings, or informal chats—we build a resilient foundation of trust that enables collaboration, innovation, and collective growth.</p>
<h2 id="2-reliability">2. Reliability</h2>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong> turns promises into predictable outcomes. Fulfil commitments on time, document your deliverables clearly, and communicate early if risks arise—no surprises. Maintain consistent quality by following agreed-upon processes, writing reproducible code, and peer-reviewing critical work. Respond promptly to requests, keep stakeholders informed of progress, and verify that hand-offs are complete before declaring tasks done. When you adopt a new tool or workflow, validate it thoroughly (advantages and disadvantages) so others can use it with confidence. By pairing transparency with disciplined follow-through, we create a dependable culture where every member, project, and partnership can stand on solid ground.</p>
<h2 id="3-trust">3. Trust</h2>
<p><strong>Trust</strong> thrives on transparent intent and consistent behavior. Share context openly, avoid hidden assumptions, honor confidentiality when entrusted with sensitive information, and credit contributions visibly. Address disagreements early—focus on evidence, listen with empathy, and seek solutions rather than blame. Clarify expectations up front and meet them reliably; if circumstances change, communicate promptly to avoid surprises. By pairing candid dialogue with dependable action, we create an environment where members feel safe to explore ideas, take calculated risks, and grow together—amplifying collective success.</p>
<h2 id="4-fairness">4. Fairness</h2>
<p><strong>Fairness</strong> demands that every decision be grounded in transparent criteria and objective evidence, not personal preference. Assess ideas and contributions on merit, apply rules consistently, and declare any potential conflicts of interest before taking part in evaluations. Encourage inclusive participation—seek out quieter voices, consider cultural contexts, and give people adequate time and information to respond. When disagreements arise, use clear procedures for appeal or mediation so everyone feels heard and treated with dignity. By embedding these practices in hiring, reviews, resource allocation, and daily collaboration, we cultivate a culture where respect and impartiality enable genuine diversity of thought and equitable outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="5-diversity">5. Diversity</h2>
<p><strong>Diversity</strong> is our competitive advantage. We actively seek and include people of varied genders, ethnicities, abilities, ages, identities, and life paths. Use inclusive language, organize accessible meetings (both virtually and physically), and accommodate different working styles and needs. When forming teams, aim for balanced representation and invite perspectives not yet heard. Recognize intersectionality—individuals may face layered challenges—and provide mentorship or resources accordingly. Celebrate cultural milestones, share learning materials, and challenge stereotypes that surface in discussion or design. By embedding these practices into hiring, evaluation, and daily collaboration, we tap a richer pool of creativity, craft solutions that serve broader audiences, and signal that every voice truly counts.</p>
<h2 id="6-equity">6. Equity</h2>
<p><strong>Equity</strong> goes beyond equal treatment by matching support to individual circumstances. Audit policies and workflows for hidden hurdles—financial, physical, cultural, or technical—and dismantle them through accessible design, flexible scheduling, and targeted resources. Distribute opportunities such as mentorship, funding, and visibility according to need and potential rather than convenience or seniority, and track outcomes to ensure interventions close gaps. Invite continuous feedback from under-represented members and adjust processes transparently. By calibrating our systems to real-world differences, we empower every contributor to succeed on merit and effort, strengthening the community as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="7-sustainability">7. Sustainability</h2>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong> means building software and processes that endure and advance the broader goals of the United Nations for a more just and livable world. Develop software under permissive open-source licenses from the beginning, contribute fixes upstream, and adopt open standards to prevent lock-in and extend the life of our work. Choose technology stacks for clear utility and rigorously optimize performance—from algorithmic efficiency to runtime resource usage—to avoid wasting energy and resources. When designing applications, evaluate how each feature tackles environmental constraints and societal needs so our solutions actively address the most pressing issues of our time. Architect systems for maintainability, efficient resource use, and graceful evolution; track their technical, social, and environmental footprints and set targets for continuous improvement. Document decisions transparently, foster inclusive contributor communities, and plan for responsible end-of-life pathways. By pairing open collaboration with long-term thinking, we deliver technology that benefits people, organizations, and the planet well into the future.</p>
<h2 id="8-responsibility">8. Responsibility</h2>
<p><strong>Responsibility</strong> transforms good intentions into tangible impact. Own each commitment from planning through follow-up—anticipate ethical, social, and environmental consequences, document decisions, and track results. If mistakes or biases surface, acknowledge them swiftly, explain remedial steps, and share lessons learned so others can avoid similar pitfalls. Mentor teammates, flag emerging risks, and ensure compliance with legal and community standards at every stage of a project. By pairing clear accountability with active stewardship, we reinforce our mission to build technology that serves society fairly, ethically, and inclusively.</p>
<h2 id="9-respect">9. Respect</h2>
<p><strong>Respect</strong> shapes every interaction. Listen actively without interrupting, acknowledge others’ expertise, and use inclusive language that honors names and pronouns. Address disagreements constructively—focus on ideas, not people—and seek understanding before responding. Uphold personal boundaries: ask permission before sharing private information or adding someone to a public thread. Harassment, discrimination, and micro-aggressions are unacceptable; report them immediately through the designated channels. Celebrate accomplishments publicly, deliver critique privately and with empathy. By modeling kindness and courtesy at all times, we maintain psychological safety and unlock honest, innovative collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="10-evidence">10. Evidence</h2>
<p><strong>Evidence</strong> grounds every decision in verifiable fact. Consult primary data, cite peer-reviewed research, and replicate key findings before acting. Document and publish methods and assumptions openly so others can audit, reproduce or extend your work, and adjust positions swiftly when new data overturns old beliefs. Share datasets, negative results, and analytical code to foster transparency and collective learning. By privileging rigorous proof over intuition or hierarchy, we sharpen our ideas, earn trust, and accelerate sustainable innovation.</p>
<h2 id="commitment-to-living-these-guidelines">Commitment to Living These Guidelines</h2>
<p>These principles are not advisory notes but daily obligations for every member of our research group—faculty, staff, students, and visiting collaborators. We weave them into recruiting, onboarding, project planning, and performance reviews so that alignment with our values is visible and measurable. Team leads model the standards in meetings and code reviews; mentors reinforce them during supervision and feedback sessions. Regular workshops and retrospectives provide space to reflect on how well we are living up to our commitments and to suggest improvements.</p>
<p>If you witness conduct that departs from these guidelines—whether subtle or severe—report it directly to <a href="/people/krusche">Stephan Krusche</a> (in person, via email, or through a confidential channel) so that issues are addressed promptly, fairly, and without retaliation. By holding ourselves and one another accountable, we strengthen collaboration, enhance communication, and ensure that our community remains a place where everyone can do their best work.</p>
